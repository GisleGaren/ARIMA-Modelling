Use-case 1: Stock Market Price Prediction for Tesla Stock

In this use-case, we will be using regression algorithm because the target variable is the stock-market price is a continuous value, instead of discrete.
Regression is designed to predict continuous numerical values and our output in this case is stock price. In this exercise, we are interested in
predicting the exact value of the Tesla stock, not classifying it into certain discrete categories. Our input includes historical stock prices and trade
volumes and these features are numerical, which regression models are relatively well suited to handle. By viewing evaluation metrics such as mean squared
errors and mean absolute errors, we can analyze the accuracy of such models by observing discrepancies between predicted values and actual values.
